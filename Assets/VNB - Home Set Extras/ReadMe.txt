--- Description ---

The aim for this package is to help set-up things quickly by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything:

- Materials and original palette (you can always modify or expand them).
(if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP, this is done with just one click from within Unity)
- Prefabs of models ready to place in scene, ready to be animated or manipulated from script (some are ready-to-use compositions of other models).

*Make sure to snap things to the grid when using tiles*

*Look at my itch.io page for details*


--- Supportive Edition [2$+] ---

[Supportive Edition available at 2$]

[The SE includes some new custom textures and modular models]

[Thanks for supporting my work, appreciate it!]
